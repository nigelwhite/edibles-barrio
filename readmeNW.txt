This is a drupal/core project so updating core is
composer update drupal/core --with-dependencies

Remote is on php 7.3 on Graham's server, running composer v 2.1.12.

18.6.20 imported local dev into edibles-barrio2 in ddev

I stupidly lost the scss that used to control the site on local dev so I now only have the production enormous css file. No preprocessing of css available.
